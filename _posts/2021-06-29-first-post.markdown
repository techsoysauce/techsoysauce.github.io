I started in IT back in 2003.  I've had a small taste of the cloud, and, i'm hooked!!!  I hope to learn as much
as i can so that i can...  well... do awesome cloud stuff.  This is my first 
post so let's hope this is the start of a wonderful cloud learning journey.
  
For now, i'll keep it brief and short.  I hope to document the technologies 
I have learned and key takeaway points. 

It's a wonderful time to be alive!
