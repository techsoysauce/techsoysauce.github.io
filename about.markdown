Hi, I'm Jose Parocua (pah-row-qua) and I love learning and above all, **understanding** how tech works.  It's amazing how this stuff works when you look at what's underneath the hood.

I've been performing Enterprise IT since 2003 in the financial services sector. I've been around computers since the Windows 95 days.

Over the years I've acquired experience in:
* Networking and Firewalls
* Active Directory
* Virtualization
* Azure
* AWS
* O365
* Email
* Cybersecurity architecture
* Vulnerability management
* Next gen malware protection
* And others currently in development

I love being a team player while empowering my team with knowledge.

Follow along with me as I walk through life and document my stumbles and successes along the way.
