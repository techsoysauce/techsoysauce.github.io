Hi, I'm Jose Parocua (pah-row-qua) and my mission in life is to learn and **understand** as much as I can.

I've been performing Enterprise IT since 2003 in the financial services sector. I've been around computers since the Windows 95 days.

Over the years I've acquired experience in:
* Networking and Firewalls
* Active Directory
* Virtualization
* Azure
* O365
* Email
* Cybersecurity architecture
* Vulnerability management
* Next gen malware protection

I love being a team player while empowering my team with knowledge.

Follow along with me as I walk through life and document my stumbles and successes along the way.
